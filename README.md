# CatBalls
This pack aim to be vivid, contrast and has that cartoony feeling.
It's a simple to look and have their unique spinoff of each block
A charming resource pack that format the world with cartoon flair
and feeling of glee, when looked at.

Dive into softer side, a whimsical realm of what Minecraft could 
have been. Reimagined under this pack that carries gentle charm
for a pleasant and visually appealing world.

The pack yet not completed, most of it is still faithful
(old textures)
Feedback, critic, support are welcome
Hope you like it!
